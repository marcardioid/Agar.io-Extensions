# Agar.io Extensions
Collection of browser extensions for the agar.io online game. These do not conflict when you use them both.

### Agar.io Server Select
Adds an input box to the homepage of agar.io that automatically shows the game server ip you are connected to.<br>
Allows you to enter a different ip so you can easily connect to the session your friends are playing in.<br>
Hides a lot of the websocket and session tech end users might find difficult to deal with to simplify the connection process.

#### Chrome

The source of the Chrome browser extension is available in `Agar.io-ServerSelect/Chrome`.

#### Firefox
The basic JavaScript has been ported to a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/" target="_blank">Greasemonkey</a> userscript for Firefox users.<br>
A standalone '.xpi'-extension will be developed if there is enough interest.
